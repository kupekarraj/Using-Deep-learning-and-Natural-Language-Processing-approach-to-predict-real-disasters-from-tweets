# Using-Deep-learning-and-Natural-Language-Processing-approach-to-predict-real-disasters-from-tweets
The purpose of this research work is to
use the combination of Natural Language
processing (NLP) and deep learning to predict the
occurrence of natural disaster from the data
generated from social media platform Twitter by
classifying the real and fake tweets. The deep
learningmodelisformedfromthecombinationof
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer and Embedding layer which
implements GloVe vector. To obtain the better
results data has been cleaned where non-significant
words and special characters are removed.
Tokenizer module is used to convert the text into
tokensinKeraslibrary.Evaluation ofthe model has
been done using accuracy and confusion matrix as
performancemetrics.Thus,themodel attainsthe
validation accuracy of .80 percent with a minimum
number of misclassified records.
